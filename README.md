gRegression
===========

Google Drive script for doing regression analysis of spreadsheet data. Build on the regression script by Tom Alexander: https://github.com/Tom-Alexander/regression-js


How to use
==========
Select x and y data by click-and-drag in the spreadsheet, then run "regression analysis" from the menu and select the relevant options. (Data must be in columns, with x values in the first selected column.)
Use the option "Create a new sheet with regression-fitted data and a scatter plot" to have the function-fitted data plotted in a chart with no extra work.


How to install
==============
You have three different options for installing gRegression:

1: Search the scripts available for installation through the standard Google interface (from "install" -> "scripts").
2: Use this link to copy a spreadsheet already containing the code: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjgECFpHWbvRdGFXeFNrbWUyV05FVTE2bHZFTXM4WWc&newcopy
3: Use the source code found here on GitHub and paste it into the code editor in a Google spreadsheet. If you do, you will also need to add the code from regression-js manually (see link to Tom Alexander's project above).
